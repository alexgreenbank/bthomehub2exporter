# bthomehub2exporter
A Prometheus Exporter for stats from a BT Smart Hub 2

Based on [this issue of a different BT Hub exporter](https://github.com/jamesnetherton/homehub-metrics-exporter/issues/14) I decided to write my own to handle the BT Smart Hub 2.

This builds on the information from [here](https://blog.habets.se/2015/03/Scraping-data-from-a-BT-home-hub-5.html).
